## 😎 The Challenge
You will have to build a comic's store using the [Marvel's API](https://developer.marvel.com/docs) taking in count the following points:
  - **UI**: The Comic's store could look like this.(Use it as a guide, but if you have better UI ideas, feel free to include those ones in your solution):

	![Ui Guide](./ui-guide-phone.png)
    
  - **Show a List of comics**: List the comics that the API returns when you request to the `/v1/public/comics` endpoint.
  - **Include a search field**: When the user type this input field, you should update the comics list based on the user entry.
  - **Filters**: Include a characters filter (This could be just a group of buttons). When user touchs on it, you should show only the comics where this character appears. (Feel free to include any other filter).
  - **Multiplatform**: Your solution should works at least for one Android device and one iOS device.

## 👀 Keep in mind
    
- As we already mentioned, we give you a boilerplate in order to make you the inital setup a little bit easer but feel free to edit or modify what ever you need.
- Feel free to include any approach or tecnology you want
- Pss pss, you could have extra points if you include unit testing in your solution
